# Beam PINNs Code

# Overview

This repository contains the code used in the article "Title of the Article". It implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving beam-related problems. The code compares computed solutions with analytical and other reference solutions.

# Running the Code

-Run the main file.
-A file selection window will appearâ€”choose the input file to be processed.
-The model will be trained automatically.
-Once training is complete, one or more CSV files containing error results and the loss values will be generated.
-Errors are computed for all implemented problems, using analytical and other reference solutions for comparison.


# Disclaimer

This code is not optimized, and some parts of its structure could be better organized.
